    <article>
        This was the first week where I made a website and taught a lesson.  I taught all about JavaScript objects.  It is neat to see all of the object oriented programming I learned for C++ applies here to JavaScript.  It is a slightly different syntax but works just the same.  It is a testament to the idea that you should learn one language really well and the concepts behind programming and then learning another language becomes significantly easier.
