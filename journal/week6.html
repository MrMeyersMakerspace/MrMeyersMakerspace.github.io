    <article>This week I taught about manipulating CSS class properties using JavaScript.  It is super simple.  You simply get the element using DOM and the add .style.whatever for the specific CSS property you want to change and set it equal to what you want it to change to.<br /><br />
    I also learned and taught a bit about HTML5 tags for video, audio, and canvas.  I learned about some additional HTML5 tags as well like header, footer, article, etc., which will be handy in the future.  The HTML5 tags certainly make video and audio a lot easier.  The canvas was particularly interesting.  I imagine that Code.org's game lab must use a canvas to display what is programmed by the students.  I'll have to dive into the source code to find out.</article>
