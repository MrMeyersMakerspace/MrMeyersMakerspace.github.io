        This week I taught about basic JavaScript (loops, conditional statements, functions, variables, parameters, arrays, and associative arrays) and CSS3 animations.  The JavaScript was super easy and boring now that I've done so much with it, especially with Spheros at school.  In fact when I taught it I didn't have a site ready so I taught it based off old sites that I've made.  I'll have to go back and make the JavaScript site later when I have more time.<br /><br />
        CSS3 animations was surprisingly fun.  It is a lot easier then I expected.  You simply change CSS properties of an object and different keyframes and it will cycle through those keyframes.  You set how long it takes and what the objects look like before and after.  This will be a lot of fun to add to my sites in the future.
