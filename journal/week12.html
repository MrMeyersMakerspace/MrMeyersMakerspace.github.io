    <h1 id="pageName">Week 12 Reflection</h1>

    <article>This week was a really difficult week with my other course CS 313 - Web Engineering II.  I spent all week getting my final project put together for that class and wasn't able to spend any time working on my final project for this class.  As such my web app is still in the design stages and I haven't had time to start writing the code.  I'm excited to get started, however, because I have some great ideas on how I am going to put it togther.  I think it will work really well and be of benefit to my students when we start needing to read resistor values.  I have no doubt that as long as I work hard I should be able to fully develop my final project next week.</article>
