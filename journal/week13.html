    <article>This week I was able to start and finish my site.  I built it step by step.  I put one feature in, tested it and made sure it worked fully, then took the next step.  I'd create a switch statement and make sure the selection was correct before actually having the switch do anything, for example.  I'd then make sure my data was passing correctly before I tried to do anything with the data.  By doing incremental improvements and additions I didn't end up with any major bugs that wasted time.  I build everything myself from the ground up using vanilla JavaScript.  I'm super proud of that fact and I think my final product is pretty awesome!  With the completion of this and my CS 313 project I am finally starting to feel like I can succeed as a developer.  I'm starting to feel really confident in my programming abilities.  That is probably the biggest takeaway for me from this class is I can teach myself whatever programming I need to know to accomplish whatever project I an creating.  I didn't like the fact that it was completely self driven without listed resources for learning the topics for the first 3/4 of the class.  But now looking back I appreciate the format because I feel confident in my ability to problem solve and learn anything I want/need to learn with programming.  This project was actually pretty fun and I'm glad I was able to build something that I am actually going to use in class with my students.</article>
