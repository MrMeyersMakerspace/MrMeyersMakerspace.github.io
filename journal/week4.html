        This week we got a 3rd member for our group and now our group meetings are going to end up being a half an hour longer.  I thought it would make less work having a 3rd member but it will, instead, create more work.  Oh well.<br /><br />
        This week I taught about AJAX requests.  I've been doing a lot with AJAX in my other class CS 313 and in my last web development class CS 213 so it is pretty easy.  I was caught up a little bit on how to send data to the server via a post request but I finally figured it out.  It certainly is a lot easier when you are using PHP but with JavaScript it works too.
