    <div id="rotateIt"><h3>CRUNCH TIME!</h3></div>
    <article>So this week is crunch time.  I have run out of time on previous weeks and fell behind the past few weeks so now I have to catch up and get everything done ASAP!  There are a couple of topics that I taught previously using other peoples websites but now I have to create my own to demonstrate that I know what those aspects of web development are all about.  I'm not too worried about it because I know I can get it all done, it is just going to be a lot of work cranking everything out.  My issue is I tend to go above and beyond the requirements, which takes me more time then I need it to.  I have to make sure that I don't spend too much time on unnecessary parts of my websites and I'll be fine.</article>
    <article>I also have forgotten to submit what I have done up to this point and so I'm submitting all of that as well.  I am over half way done but I still have a decent amount left.  One nice thing is I can combine three topics into one website (CSS Transitions, CSS Translations, and Activating CSS with JavaScript).  That will definitely save some time.</article>
