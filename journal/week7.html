    <article>
        This week I was suppose to teach about JSON parse and stringify but I ran out of time.  Life is insane right now and I'm recovering from a stomach bug that has been going around our house, my baby starting to cut teeth and not sleeping, my wife's family in town, and her sister in law's wedding.  I haven't had time to think let alone write a JSON webpage.  I'll get it done later once everyone gets feeling better and my wife's family goes back home.
