		This week I cemented my idea for my final project and got started on it.  I'm a fan of creating things that solve a problem.  One problem my students at school have is when we get to the electronics unit they don't know how to read a resistor and have a hard time figuring it out.  What I'm going to do is create a simple single page app that will allow them to enter in the color code of a resistor, which will then display that color code on a visual representation of the resistor using fancy CSS animations and such.  Then it will spit out a value for that resistor.  At that point they can choose to either save the value in a table down below so they don't have to look up that specific resistor again or they'll lookup a new resistor value.

		I like this idea because it is something I can actually use with my students at school.  It also will incorporate all the CSS, JavaScript, and LocalStorage stuff that we've learned so I can clearly demonstrate my mastery of each of the topics.  I need to make sure I take some time, however, to plan out what I want to app to look like before I start diving in and coding it.  I've learned that having a plan on the outset will make the process a lot smoother.  That is my goal of this week is to finish the plan for the layout of the app so I can start programming it next week.
