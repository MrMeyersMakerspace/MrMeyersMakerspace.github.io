    <h1 id="pageName">Week 10 Reflection</h1>

    <p>This week was a really busy week.  I had quite a few topics to finish up.  I feel like I am understanding these topics really well and am coming up with interesting ways to implament them.  These topics just build upon what I've already learned in CS 213 and what I am currently learning in CS 313.  Understanding parse() and stringify() in particular have been really helpful as I've been creating a Node.js application in CS 313 that sends and retrieves data from a Postgres server I created.  I also have been able to really help my team members this week in understanding those concepts so that they can use them to store and retrieve data from localStorage for their projects.  Overall it has been a crazy but good week.</p>
