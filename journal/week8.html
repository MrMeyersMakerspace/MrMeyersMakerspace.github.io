        This week I'm learning about localStorage and CSS transforms.  The concept of localStorage seems redundant to me, maybe because I learned about php sessions before I learned about localStorage but it seems like it would be a lot better to store data using a session instead.  My group helped me understand that the value is using the local computer hard drive instead of having to take up space on the server and I guess that makes sense.  It does persist between pages and when the browser is closed so it acts like a session.  I guess that works.<br /><br />
        I didn't have time to make a site about transforms before our meeting but I'll get that done later in the week and just do a YouTube video about it.  Transforms seem like they are fun, especially when matched up with transitions, animations, and triggered by JavaScript.
