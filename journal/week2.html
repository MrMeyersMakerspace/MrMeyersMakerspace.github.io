    <article>
        This week was another simple week.  I met with my partner (our third member dropped the class) and we organized a schedule for each of us to teach each other each topic.  I also was able to meet with the professor for office hours and learn more about what is expected.  It looks like the requirements for fluency are pretty basic.  For each topic we have to make a website demonstrating that topic and then have a recording teaching what that topic is.  We really will be teaching ourselves each topic, however.  Our professor will eventually hold office hours showing some coding stuff but that's it.  Another self taught class.  It makes me wonder why I'm paying BYU-Idaho to teach myself when I already have a degree, just not in software engineering.  Oh well.
