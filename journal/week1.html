    <article>
        This week was a simple intro to the class.  It looks like there are 13 topics I have to demonstrate at least basic mastery of by week 10.  After that point there is a final project I'll complete using that technology.  The layout is super open and we pretty much teach ourselves.  We will also meet in small groups once a week to teach each other.  I have no idea what that will look like or what demonstrating basic mastery looks like either.  I guess we'll see.
