    <h1 id="pageName">Standard JavaScript Events</h1>
    <h2>Standard JavaScript Events Including those for Mobile Devices ( Ex. onTouchBegin, onLoad, etc.) and Animation
        and Transition Events</h2>

    <h3>JavaScript Events</h3>
    <p>There are a lot of events that are available for JavaScript. These events are simply things that happen to HTML
        elements either through something the user does or something the browser does. One of the most commmon events is
        the <code>onclick</code> event that triggers when an element is clicked. When that item is clicked it calls a
        function that then does whatever the programmer specifies. There are many other user initiated events.</P>
    <p>Other events are triggered by the browser like <code>onload</code>. This event is triggered when the object is
        loaded by the browser. The most common use is to put <code>onload</code> inside of the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>
        element to cause a JavaScript function to run once the page is loaded. Wherever it appears it will run
        JavaScript once that element is finished loading. On this page, for example, there was an <code>alert()</code>
        that was triggered once the page finished loading due to a <code>onload</code> event in the
        <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> element of the page.</p>

    <h3>Mobile Friendly Events</h3>
    <p>There are some events that are more mobile friendly than others. Some of these events are touch events like
        <code>touchstart</code>, <code>touchmove</code>, <code>touchend</code>, and <code>touchcancel</code>. They work
        as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>touchstart</code> - triggers when the element is touched by the user</li>
        <li><code>touchmove</code> - triggers when the user touches the element and then moves his or her finger across
            the screen</li>
        <li><code>touchend</code> - triggers when the user stops touching the element and the screen (not to be confused
            with touchmove which still works even if the user isn't touching the element as long as he or she is still
            touching the screen)</li>
        <li><code>touchcancel</code> - triggers when a touch is interrupted by something else. This seems to be used as
            an error handling type event when the normal sequence of <code>touchstart</code>, <code>touchmove</code>,
            and <code>touchend</code> is interrupted for some reason like too many touch points, pressing the home
            button while touching, and/or pressing the lock button while touching. A great article outlining when this
            is actually used can be found <a
                href="https://alxgbsn.co.uk/2011/12/23/different-ways-to-trigger-touchcancel-in-mobile-browsers/">here</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Demo</h3>
    <p>Below you will find several demos using some touch events. First is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that changes it's
        width to a random value when it is touched thanks to a <code>touchstart</code> event and JavaScript function.
        Next is a div that shows your coordinates while you move your finger around it thanks to a
        <code>touchmove</code> event and JavaScript function. Last is a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> that will change colors
        after you remove your finger thanks to a <code>touchend</code> event and JavaScript function.</p>
