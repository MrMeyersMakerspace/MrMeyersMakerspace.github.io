    <h1 id="pageName">HTML5 Tags - Audio, Video, and Canvas</h1>
    <p>HTML5 added a ton of new features for web developers to use including more forms of input, input attributes, form elements, structure elements, graphic elements, and media.  This page is going to focus on three of those new tags, the <code>&#60;audio&#62;</code>, <code>&#60;video&#62;</code>, and <code>&#60;canvas&#62;</code> tags.  These allow you to easily embed natively hosted audio and video content as well as create graphics on the fly using, usually, JavaScript.  Before these tags all of these features were only accomplished by using plugins, and couldn't be handled with native HTML.  Now we can do it with straight HTML.  We'll dive into each individually, what they bring to the table, and how they work.</p>

    <h3>Audio Tag</h3>
    <p>The audio tag allows you to embed audio into your site without having to use an external plugin.  You have control on whether or not you have controls available for the user and whether or not that audio automatically plays or is trigged by the user.  These controls can even been controlled via JavaScript so you can create your own control buttons instead of the build in controls.  All browsers support MP3 files, with most also supporting WAV files, and all but Edge, IE, and Safari also supporting OGG files.</p>
    <p>To create an audio element we simply use the <code>&#60;audio&#62;</code> tag, define the source, and then what type of audio file it is.  Then you can add <code>controls</code> if you want the audio to also have controls available for playing, pausing, controlling the sound level, and the ability to download the audio file.  Below is a sample music file with the code necessary for it to work.  Not shown is an audio file called "music.mp3" that is also hosted in the same folder.</p>

    <audio controls src="music.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">Your browser does not support the <code>&#60;audio&#62;</code> element</audio>
    <br />
    <p>Code:</p>
    <code>&#60;audio controls src="music.mp3" type="audio/mpeg"&#62;</code>Your browser does not support the <code>&#60;audio&#62;</code> element<code>&#60;/audio&#62;</code>
    <br /><br />

    <p>You'll notice the text inbetween the <code>&#60;audio&#62;</code> tags.  This text will appear if the user is running the site on an older browser that does not support the <code>&#60;audio&#62;</code> tag or the audio file type used.  This is also true for the <code>&#60;video&#62;</code> tag as well.</p>
    <br /><br />

    <h3>Video Tag</h3>
    <p>The video tag, like the audio tag, allows you to embed media in your page without the need of an external plugin, in this case video.  Also like the audio tag you can decide whether or not the video will have controls and whether or not that video automatically plays.  These controls can also be controlled externally.</p>
